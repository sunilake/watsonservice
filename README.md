# Language Translator Node.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/language-translator-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/language-translator-nodejs)

  The IBM Watson&trade; [Language Translator][service_url] service provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that lets you identify the language of text, and then use a custom business domain to translate the text from one supported language to another.  
  You can translate either by letting the service identify the source language or by selecting a source language and then by selecting a target language, and a business domain. Domain translation is linguistically targeted these business domains:
  * *The News domain* - targeted at news articles and transcripts, it translates English to and from Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, or Spanish. It also translates Spanish to and from French.
  * *The Conversational domain* - targeted at conversational colloquialisms, it translates English to and from Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, or Spanish.
  * *The Patent domain* - targeted at technical and legal terminology, it translates Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, or Spanish to English.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/language-translator-nodejs)

## Getting started

1. You need a Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up][sign_up]. Experimental Watson Services are free to use.

1. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool if you haven't already.

1. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change `<application-name>` to something unique. The name you use determines the URL of your application. For example, `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

    ```yaml
    applications:
    - services:
      - language-translator-service
      name: <application-name>
      command: node app.js
      path: .
      memory: 128M
    ```

1. Connect to Bluemix with the command line tool.

  ```sh
  cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  cf login
  ```

1. Create the Language Translator service in Bluemix.

    ```sh
    cf create-service language_translator lite language-translator-service
    cf create-service-key language-translator-service myKey
    cf service-key language-translator-service myKey
    ```

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  You will update the `.env` with the information you retrieved in steps 5.

  The `.env` file will look something like the following:

  ```none
  SPEECH_TO_TEXT_USERNAME=<username>
  SPEECH_TO_TEXT_PASSWORD=<password>
  ```

1. Install the dependencies you application need:

  ```none
  npm install
  ```

1. Start the application locally:

  ```none
  npm start
  ```

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

1. **Optional:** Push the application to Bluemix:

  ```none
  cf push
  ```

After completing the steps above, you are ready to test your application. Start a browser and enter the URL of your application.

            <your application name>.mybluemix.net
